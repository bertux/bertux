## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**bertux/bertux** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

The game is:
- to feel like a LLM by filling the gaps in this portrait to describe me in the way you see me.
- then submit it as a PR of course.
- because you will receive as a NFT for your creative contribution.

Here are some ideas to get you started but it's permissionless so feel free to be as creative as you can:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...

Because it's all a matter of subjective perspective:
- So what may be obvious to you may not be obvious to me.
- That's what I try to remind to myself every day before trying pair programming sessions.
