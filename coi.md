## Hello world ðŸ‘‹

The game is:
- to feel like a LLM by filling the gaps in this portrait to describe me in the way you see me.
- then submit it as a PR of course.
- because you will receive as a NFT for your creative contribution.

Here are some ideas to get you started but it's permissionless so feel free to be as creative as you can:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on {Cedra Ecosystem, Superfluid integrations, FeverTokens DevRel}
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about {ReFi, Vibe Learning, Ecosystem Engineering}
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to cooperate on {Blockchain Development, Product Design, Web3 Hackathon Mentoring}
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with {Impact Metrics, Eco Credits, Community Building}
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about - {smart contract development, logics, web3 tooling}
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: {Telegram, Discord, Farcaster}
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun facts: {Likes to take the train after 10:00pm, We already spent more than 5 hours in call, Helped me to deploy my first contract}

Because it's all a matter of subjective perspective:
- So what may be obvious to you may not be obvious to me.
- That's what I try to remind to myself every day before trying pair programming sessions.
